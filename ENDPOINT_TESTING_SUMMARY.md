# Endpoint Testing Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the comprehensive endpoint testing guide created for the INKINGI RESCURE application. The guide includes detailed instructions and examples for testing all 19 modules and their associated endpoints.

## Available Modules

The application contains the following 19 modules, each with full CRUD operations:

1. Users
2. Roles
3. Emergency Reports
4. Threads
5. Messages
6. Community Posts
7. District Services
8. Events
9. Feedback
10. Incident Logs
11. Notifications
12. Post Comments
13. Post Likes
14. Report Status History
15. Resources
16. Responder Profiles
17. Subscriptions
18. System Settings
19. Audit Logs

## Test Data

The guide includes comprehensive test data that can be used for testing all endpoints:

- 4 Users with different roles
- 5 Roles with different permission levels
- 3 Emergency Reports with different statuses
- 2 Threads for emergency reports
- 3 Messages in communication threads

## How to Use the Testing Guide

### 1. Reference Document
The full endpoint testing guide is available in:
```
ENDPOINT_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

### 2. Structure
Each module section in the guide includes:
- Available HTTP methods (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- Example curl commands for each endpoint
- Required data fields and formats
- Expected responses

### 3. Testing Order
It's recommended to test modules in dependency order:
1. Roles (required for Users)
2. Users (required for most other modules)
3. Emergency Reports (required for Threads)
4. Threads (required for Messages)
5. Other modules in any order

### 4. Example Test Commands
```bash
# Get all users
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users

# Create a new emergency report
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/emergency-reports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "report-test-001",
    "type": "Test Emergency",
    "severity": "Low",
    "description": "Test emergency report",
    "lat": -1.9441,
    "lng": 30.0619,
    "district": "Kigali City",
    "reported_by": "user-ci-001",
    "status": "Pending"
  }'

# Update a user
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/users/user-ci-001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated David Citizen",
    "availability": "online"
  }'

# Delete a temporary record
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/emergency-reports/report-test-001
```

## Current Implementation Status

Note: Some endpoints may return placeholder responses as the service implementations are being completed. The testing guide provides the correct API structure and expected behavior once fully implemented.

## HTTP Status Codes

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request (validation error)
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Testing Best Practices

1. Always test the full CRUD cycle (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. Test error conditions (invalid data, missing required fields)
3. Verify data consistency after updates
4. Clean up test data to maintain database integrity
5. Test related entities and relationships

This testing guide should provide everything needed to thoroughly test all endpoints in the INKINGI RESCURE application once the service implementations are complete.
